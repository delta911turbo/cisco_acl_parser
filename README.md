Powershell ACL Parser
=================

Parses through Cisco ACL list and outputs to a formated XML file. The base ACL that I was provided for the project
is a bit unique, as compared to other formats I have found online. If you find a format of ACL that does not parse
correctly, please let me know and I'll work with the format to conform to all standards.  I have also provided a 
sample ACL list that was used to create script.  In the file ACL_FORMAT_LIST I have started to compile a list of
every possible format, including ones that the script currently does not parse.
